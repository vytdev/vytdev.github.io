# Cookie Statement

This Cookie Statement explains how we use cookies and similar technologies to
provide, customize, and improve your experience on VYT Hub. By continuing
to browse or use our services, you agree to our use of cookies as described
in this policy.

## What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files stored on your device by websites you visit.
They are commonly used to make websites function properly and to enhance your
experience. For example, cookies can remember your preferences, such as your
chosen theme or language.

## How We Use Cookies

We use cookies for the following purposes:

- To remember your preferred theme.
- To remember whether you have seen our cookie banner.

Unlike many other websites, we *strictly* do not use cookies for tracking page
views or for advertising purposes. Our use of cookies is solely for your
convenience.

Rest assured, your data stays on your device. We do not transmit any of it
over the internet. Your privacy is our priority.

## Local Data Stored

We use a technology called `localStorage` to store information on your device.
It helps retain your preferences across browser tabs and sessions. Here's what
we store:

| Key | Options | Purpose |
| --- | ------- | ------- |
| `theme` | `light`, `dark` | To remember your preferred theme. |
| `cookie-consent` | `accepted`, `rejected` | To remember whether you have seen and accepted our cookie banner. |

There are no hidden cookies. That is *everything*.

## Third-Party Cookies

We strictly affirm that we do not use any third-party services. This includes,
but is not limited to, advertising networks and analytics tools. No
third-party services means no third-party cookies.

## Your Cookie Choices

We do not include a built-in cookie management tool on our site, as we aim to
avoid unnecessary bloat and maintain fast performance. However, your browser
likely allows you to clear cookies and local data.

To do so, go to your browser settings > Site settings > `vytdev.github.io` >
Clear data (or similar). The exact steps may vary depending on your browser.

## Changes and Amendments

We may update this Cookie Statement to reflect changes in our practices or
legal requirements. Any updates will be posted on this page and communicated
across the site.

## Contact Information

If you have any questions or concerns about this Cookie Statement, please feel
free to [contact us](./contact.md). We value your feedback.
