# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your data on this informational
website, VYT Hub.

## What Data Do We Collect?

We **do not collect** any personal information from you.

To "collect data" means storing or transmitting information for purposes
beyond the immediate function it serves &mdash; and we do not do that. We may
store certain preferences (like your theme choice), but these stay entirely
on your device and are not transmitted anywhere.

::: hl note
Our [contact page](./contact.md) may ask for your email address. This is only
used to respond directly to your inquiries or concerns &mdash; nothing more.
:::

## How Do We Use This Data?

Since we do not collect personal data, we do not use it.

The only information stored (such as your theme preference) is used locally
on your device to improve your experience. It serves a functional purpose
and is never shared or analyzed.

For more information about your preferences, please see our
[Cookie Statement](./cookie.md).

## Data Sharing

We do not share any data because we do not collect any to begin with. There
is no analytics, no ads, and no third-party integrations &mdash; your data
remains untouched and private.

## Your Rights

You are in full control of your data, because it never leaves your device.
This site is built to be privacy-neutral &mdash; no data is processed,
stored, or tracked.

## Children's Privacy

This website is intended for a general audience and does not target or
knowingly collect information from children under 13.

As no personal data is collected from any users, there is nothing gathered
from minors either &mdash; by design.

## Security

Because we do not collect or transmit any of your data, your privacy is
inherently protected. Nothing is sent to our servers (we do not have any!),
so your information stays with you.

However, if you manually tamper with your local settings or data, any
resulting issues are your responsibility. We are not liable for an
self-inflicted technical hiccups.

## Changes and Amendments

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or
legal requirements. Any updates will be posted on this page and communicated
across the site.

## Contact Information

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please feel
free to [contact us](./contact.md). We value your feedback.
