# Science Against the Floods

Each time there is a storm, many of us lie awake at night, nervously watching
the water rise &mdash; hoping they will not enter our home. It is because we
have been doing it all wrong.

In a press briefing at the Summit Hotel as part of the Regional Science,
Technology, and Innovation Week celebration, Department of Science and
Technology (DOST) Secretary Renato Solidum urged to approach the implementation
of flood control projects scientifically.

Renato suggested making tailored interventions in some specific river basins,
though such approach requires proper assessments on waterways and evaluation of
construction risks in these areas. He also said that we have the data to work
on it readily available online, so we only need to worry about the
infrastructures.

"If we build a road with a height of 10 centimeters, it essentially blocks the
flow of water from one side to the other. This can create a dam effect,
potentially increasing flooding in certain areas if proper drainage is not
implemented. This is what we should be thinking of: what the effect of the
current project on the next flood is", he said. Though the DOST is not involved
in flood control planning, it can still recommend ways to improve them.

We should not only build for the sake of progress &mdash; we should also plan
and make strategic decisions for a better sustainable future. Planning also
avoids the costly cycle of demolishing and rebuilding whenever constructions
fails. Science is also a crucial backend to make our choices stand the evolving
threat of flooding and climate change.

We must take decisive, science-based actions so that when the next storm comes,
we can finally sleep completely at ease. Flood may be natural, but each one
should teach us how to prevent the next.
