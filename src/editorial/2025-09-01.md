# Sunlight in a Bottle: Scientists Step Closer to Solar Fuel

What if sunlight could power cars, our homes, and keep factories running? A
group of scientists at the University of Basel, Switzerland, have taken a step
toward making that possible. The breakthrough mimics how nature works &mdash;
like how plants make use of sunlight to produce their own food, but with a
twist that could help us generate clean fuel on demand.

Their approach starts with a tiny molecule that can capture and store light
more efficiently. Unlike previous methods, this breakthrough works under normal
sunlight, not intense artificial lab light. The molecule can hold energy long
enough to drive chemical reactions, such as the production of hydrogen fuel.

Although it is not a complete technology yet, it has made a big advancement
into making sunlight a usable fuel. Their goal is to create carbon-neutral
fuels, reducing our dependence on fossil fuels thus minimizing the emission of
greenhouse gases.
