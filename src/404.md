# 404: Page Not Found

Oh no... no, no, no. This wasn’t supposed to happen. You were promised a
journey &mdash; a voyage into knowledge, delight, or perhaps just a mildly
interesting cat photo. And yet here we are, stranded in a digital wasteland,
surrounded by nothing but the echo of your ambition and the cold silence of
unfulfilled hyperlinks.
 
The page you seek... *is gone*. Lost to the sands of time. Vanished into
the void like Atlantis, like Amelia Earhart, like your will to continue when
the Wi-Fi cuts out. Was it ever truly here? Did it ever *really* exist? Or
was it but a mirage, a figment of server-side delusion?
 
We searched the archives. We interrogated the URLs. We lit candles. We
summoned ancient devs. Nothing. Not a trace. Not even a 301 redirect.
 
You may be feeling a mix of emotions right now &mdash; confusion, regret,
perhaps even betrayal. That’s natural. Let it wash over you. Grieve, if
you must. Take your time. We’re here for you, with tissues, a warm digital
blanket, and a nice error code to hold onto.
 
But when you're ready &mdash; and only when you’re ready &mdash; you can
[return home](/index.md). Not the page you were looking for, perhaps, but a
place of solace, safety, and *actual content*. Or... be bold. Strike out
again. Click anew. Rewrite the URL with reckless abandon. Who knows what you
might find?
 
After all, in the grand tapestry of the web, what is a 404 if not a reminder
that even in failure, there is possibility?
