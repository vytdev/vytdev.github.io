# About Me

Hi! I'm Vincent Yanzee J. Tan, 15 years old and endlessly curious. Welcome
to **VYT Hub** &mdash; my personal knowledge space!

Here, Iâ€™ll share my ideas, write documentation, maybe run a blog, and even
build a mini-encyclopedia (kind of like my own Wikipedia).

If you're wondering about the informal tone &mdash; well, it's a personal
site. Who still talks *that* formal these days anyway? That said, Iâ€™ll keep
things casual but not careless. My goalâ€™s to be engaging, not distracting.

Writing is freedom, sure &mdash; but every freedom carries responsibility
(whoa, serious mode). Anyway, let me introduce myself:

## I, Me, and Myself

I already dropped my name. Iâ€™m a developer &mdash; actually, more like a young
engineer, if you count the way I think about systems and architecture.
Hereâ€™s a quick snapshot of me:

- Pronouns: he/him
- Age: 15
- From: Philippines
- Favourite language: **C**
- Favourite films/books: *Harry Potter*
- Favourite game: *Minecraft*

I enjoy building high-performance virtual machines, designing my own
general-purpose language, and DJing on the side. Maths? Iâ€™m pretty good
at it &mdash; even earned special awards at school &mdash; but Science wins
my heart. Chemistry and Physics fascinate me. Iâ€™ve even made up loads of
theories just for the fun of it.

Iâ€™m also an aspiring novelist. Got ideas stacked up, just need time to
turn them into books. I like reading research papers too &mdash; though Iâ€™ve
still got a lot to learn in data science. As for beliefs, Iâ€™m an
*agnostic atheist*.

So that's all about myself... in summary, Iâ€™m a teenager. But hopefully, an
interesting one.

## Support Me ðŸŽ‰

A little support goes a long way! If youâ€™d like to help me keep creating,
you can do so here:
