# About Me

If you're wondering about the informal tone &mdash; well, it's a personal
site. Who still talks *that* formal these days anyway? That said, I’ll keep
things casual but not careless. My goal’s to be engaging, not distracting.

Writing is freedom, sure &mdash; but every freedom carries responsibility
(whoa, serious mode). Anyway, let me introduce myself:

## I, Me, and Myself

I already dropped my name. I’m a developer &mdash; actually, more like a young
engineer, if you count the way I think about systems and architecture.
Here’s a quick snapshot of me:

- Pronouns: he/him
- Age: 15
- From: Philippines
- Favourite language: **C**
- Favourite films/books: *Harry Potter*
- Favourite game: *Minecraft*

I enjoy building high-performance virtual machines, designing my own
general-purpose language, and DJing on the side. Maths? I’m pretty good
at it &mdash; even earned special awards at school &mdash; but Science wins
my heart. Chemistry and Physics fascinate me. I’ve even made up loads of
theories just for the fun of it.

I’m also an aspiring novelist. Got ideas stacked up, just need time to
turn them into books. I like reading research papers too &mdash; though I’ve
still got a lot to learn in data science. As for beliefs, I’m an
*agnostic atheist*.

So that's all about myself... in summary, I’m a teenager. But hopefully, an
interesting one.
