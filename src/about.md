# About Me

Hi, I'm Vinecent Yanzee J. Tan.

I made this site (both the build sys and frontend) because I want my own design
for what I thought a technical reference book. It came great. The search engine
is my favourite part.

I wanna say my handle `vytdev` will no longer be active someday Mojang decided
to implement a built-in debug stick to Bedrock.

## Support Me 🎉

A little support goes a long way! If you’d like to help me keep creating,
you can do so here:

<a href='https://ko-fi.com/W7W51I5VSO' target='_blank'>
  <img height='36' style='border:0px;height:36px;'
       src='https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/kofi6.png?v=6'
       border='0' alt='Buy Me a Coffee at ko-fi.com' />
</a>

Thanks!
